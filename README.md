The purpose of this project was to use the SQL database to create and store and update employee info. With this youre able to view employee, dept and roles; as well as add employees departments and roles. I was able to get closely familiar with SQL and understand concepts and terms like seeds, schemas and how to set up inquirer and be able to connect to a port by properly setting up your main index,js file.
